If you like what you see, give it a star! ‚≠ê

A cheatsheet containing examples of the usage of functions (and solutions to specific exercises) is included in the root, both as a notebook and as a searchable HTML file. Be aware that file paths are relative to the system on which the cheatsheet was created - it should be fairly easy to insert your own paths, though.
